        <p>Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is one of the most popular variants of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. All players in the game use these shared community cards in conjunction with their own hole cards to each make their best possible five-card poker hand.</p>
        <p>Here are the winning poker hands, from highest to lowest:</p>

        <p>River</p>
    </div>
    <div> 
        <p>Examine the "river" card and decide on the hand you'll play. After the dealer "burns" the top card on the deck, they'll put 1 last card face up next to the “turn” card. This final card is called the “river.” Check your hand and the community cards to decide on your best 5-card hand. Then, bet, call, or fold</p>
        <p>If the rules allow it, you may be able to exchange your hand 1 final time before or after betting. However, this isn’t common in professional games.</p>

        <p>Turn</p>
        <p>In poker, the turn is the fourth community card dealt after the flop. The dealer burns a card, then reveals the turn. A new betting round follows, where players evaluate their hands and decide their actions.
